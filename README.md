# material-components-web-typescript

## Description 

Trying to setup an web project without angular and gulp.

Keeping it simple and optimized so donÂ´t need to think about build scripts and alot of watchers and dozen of configurations.

*Just focus on coding, all you need is pointing your webserver to your map folder and run index.html*

-----

**Simple setup using**

* Material design web component
* Typescript
* Requirejs
* Vue
* Sass

**Watchers**

*Execute script in separate terminal view.*

* watch-tsc.sh - watching tsc files changes.
* watch-sass.sh - watching sass files changes.
